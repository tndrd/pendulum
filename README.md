# Double pendulum simulation demo

This is a tiny project, which utilizes my own implementation of Runge-Kutta ODE solver to numerically integrate the dynamics of a double pendulum. The computation is implemented from scratch using *numpy*, rendering is done via *pygame*.

More examples of ODE solvers and their applications can be found in my [Computational Mathematics Repository](https://github.com/tndrd/mipt-comp-math).
The derivation of pendulum's Lagrange equations can be found [here](https://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/DoublePendulum.html).
